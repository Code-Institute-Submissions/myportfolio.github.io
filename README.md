# ABOUT
I am a recent postgraduate student seeking opportunities to launch my career in the web development field. I have gained valuable experience by completing several web development projects utilizing HTML and CSS. 

I am highly motivated, constantly seeking new challenges, and approach them with a determined "can-do" attitude. In addition to my proficiency in HTML and CSS, I have also familiarized myself with JavaScript, which has allowed me to enhance the interactivity and functionality of websites. 

Throughout my academic journey, I actively engaged in various web development courses and workshops, honing my skills and staying abreast of the latest industry trends. 

## PORTFOLIO
In this section I have explained the project I have done during my study in university. In August 2019, I proudly represented Cardiff Metropolitan University at the Science Fair organized by the British Council in Thailand. 

This prestigious event provided me with a platform to showcase my robotics project to esteemed individuals, including the Thai Education Minister and the Ambassador of the British Council. It was an incredible opportunity to demonstrate the capabilities of my project and its potential impact. Moreover, I had the pleasure of sharing my knowledge and inspiring young pupils from Thailand, sparking their interest in robotics and technology.
