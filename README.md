<p>This website is my personal portfolio website, where I have shared my experience and skills. I am a recent postgraduate student seeking opportunities to launch my career in the web development field. I have gained valuable experience by completing several web development projects utilizing HTML and CSS. I am highly motivated, constantly seeking new challenges, and approach them with a determined "can-do" attitude. In addition to my proficiency in HTML and CSS, I have also familiarized myself with JavaScript, which has allowed me to enhance the interactivity and functionality of websites. Throughout my academic journey, I actively engaged in various web development courses and workshops, honing my skills and staying abreast of the latest industry trends.</p>
